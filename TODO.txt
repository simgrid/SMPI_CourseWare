Topic #1:

# Activity 1
# Step 1
-> I would add a second argument for the tint (unless it never changes). Set the output filename to sprintf("./julia-%d-%.2f", n, tint)? (that will make sense later)
-> I would also mention the compilation flags (-Wall., possibly -g), memory leaks and valgrind
-> Storing 2-D data in a row-major 1-D array 

# Step2
-> Verify that your program outputs the expected Julia set [...]

Give a few expected samples, 100, 201, ... or better provide a docker image to verify them
$ docker run [...] julia-1000-0.5.bmp
PASS
$ docker run [...] julia-1003-0.5.bmp
FAIL


Topic #3/4: Stencil application?


Topic #4 (Performance):
    - Add asynchronous broadcast to the MM application (once SMPI supports it? or
      have the students implement it by hand?? likely the former option is better)


Topic #5: come up with ideas
