SMPI CourseWare is a set of homework assignments focused on teaching high
performance computing and distributed memory programming. These assignments use
<i>simulation</i>. More specifically, the modules use
  <a href="http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/latest/doc/group__SMPI__API.html">SMPI</a> (Simulated MPI),
 a simulator for <a href="http://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/docs.html">MPI</a> applications provided as part of
 <a href="http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr">SimGrid</a>.
 </p>

<p class="ui">
<b>This not a self-contained MPI course</b>. Although some tutorial information is provided, the intent is for this material
to be used as part of existing curricula (university courses, training programs, etc.). <b>If you are an independent
learner, you need to learn about MPI before doing these assignments.</b>
</p>

<p class="ui">
 Using the navigation bar on the left you can see the specific learning objectives,
 and explore the covered topics. Each topic consists on hands-on modules, which each
 include brief tutorial information as well as homework activities. Topic #0 is obviously
 a good place to start.
