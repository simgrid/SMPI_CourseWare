  <h3 class="ui header">Overview</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    <b>Objective: </b> To implement the "outer product" matrix multiplication algorithm in a distributed
    memory manner using message passing.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ui header">2-D Data Distribution</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    For this module, we use a <i>2-D block data distribution</i>.
    More precisely, we consider the C = A×B multiplication
    where all three matrices are square of dimensions N×N. All matrices
    contain <b>single precision elements</b> (<code>float</code>).
    The execution takes place on p processors, <b>where p is a perfect square and √p
    divides N</b>. Each processor thus holds a
    N/√p × N/√p square block of each matrix. </p>

  <p class="ui">
    For instance, with N=6, consider the example matrix A as shown below:
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:center;" class="ui">
    <pre>
        10 20 30 40 50 60
        11 21 31 41 51 61
        12 22 32 42 52 62
        13 23 33 43 53 63
        14 24 34 44 54 64
        15 25 35 45 55 65
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p class="ui">
    Now let's assume that p=4. The 4 processes are logically organized in a 2x2 grid (hence the name of the data
    distribution) in row-major order as follows:
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:center;" class="ui">

  <table class="ui collapsing celled table">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>process #0</td>
      <td>process #1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>process #2</td>
      <td>process #3</td>
    </tr>
   </tbody>
  </table>

  </p>

  <p class="ui">
    In this setup, for instance, process #0 holds the following 3x3 block of matrix A:
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:center;" class="ui">
    <pre>
        10 20 30
        11 21 31
        12 22 32
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p class="ui">
    and process #3 holds the following 3x3 block of matrix A:
  </p>

  <p style="text-align:center;" class="ui">
    <pre>
        43 53 63
        44 54 64
        45 55 65
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p>At process #2, element with value 54 has local indices (1,1), but its global indices are (4,4), assuming that
      indices start at 0.

  <h3 class="ui header">Roadmap</h3>
  <p class="ui">This module consists of <b>2 activities, each described in its own tab above, which should be done in
    sequence:</b>
  </p>
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #1:</b> Have each MPI process allocate and initialize its own
         block of particular matrices, using the 2-D distribution scheme.

    <li class="item"><b>Activity #2:</b> Implement the outer product matrix multiplication algorithm.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="ui header">What to turn in</h3>
  <p class="ui">You should turn in a single archive (or a github repo) with:

    <div class="item">All source code</div>
    <div class="item">XML platform files and hostfiles (see details in the activities)</div>

<div class="ui tab segment " data-tab="2d_matrices">
  <div class="ui container segment raised">In this activity we distribute the matrices across the MPI processes, which
  entails dealing with local vs. global indexing.  Recall that we consider 3 NxN matrices (A, B, and C). This
  activity consists of a single step, as described below.

</div>


<div class="ui bottom attached tab segment active" data-tab="data_distribution">

  <p class="ui">
  Implement an MPI program called <code>matmul_init</code> (<code>matmul_init.c</code>) that takes a
  single command-line argument, <i>N</i>, which is a strictly positive integer. <i>N</i> is the
  dimension of the square matrices that we multiply. Your program should check that the number of processes
  is a perfect square, and that its square root divides N (printing an error message and exiting if this is
  not the case).
</p>

<p class="ui">
  The objective of the program is for each process to allocate and initialize its block of each matrix.
  We multiply particular matrices, defined by:
  </p>
<p class="ui">
  <i>A<sub>i,j</sub> = i</i> &nbsp; and  &nbsp; <i>B<sub>i,j</sub> = i + j</i>.
</p>



<p class="ui">
  <b>The above is with global indices, which go from 0 to N-1.</b>
</p>


<p class="ui">
Given the above definitions of A and B, there is a simple analytical solution
  for C. There is thus a closed-form expression for the sum of the
  elements of C: <b><i>N<sup>3</sup> (N - 1)<sup>2</sup> / 2</i></b>.
  You will use this formula to check the validity of your matrix
  multiplication implementation in Activity #2.
</p>

<p class="ui">
  Have each process allocate its blocks of A, B, and C, initialize its blocks
  of A and B to the appropriate values, and then print out the content of
  these blocks.  Each process should print its MPI rank (the "linear rank")
  as well as its
  2-D rank, which is easy to determine based on the linear rank. Note that MPI
  provides a set of functions for handling Cartesian coordinates, which you
  can also use (see the documentation for <code>MPI_Cart_rank</code> and
  related functions).
  </p>

<p class="ui">
  For instance, here is an excerpt from the output (that generated by the process of rank 2)
  for p=4 and N=8, using
  <a href="./cluster_crossbar_64.xml">cluster_crossbar_64.xml</a> as a platform file
  and <a href="./hostfile_64.txt">hostfile_64.txt</a> as a hostfile (since this module is
  about correctness, you can use pretty much any such valid files).

[...]</code></pre></figure>

</div>



<p class="ui">
  Note that due to the convenience of simulation,
  the output from one process will never be interleaved with the output of
  another process. If you run this code "for real" with MPI, instead of SMPI,
  output will be interleaved and additional synchronization will be needed
  to make the output look nice.
  The order in which the processes output their blocks is inconsequential.
  You may want to use a barrier synchronization
  to first see all blocks of A and then all blocks of B though.

  </p>

<p class="ui">
  Obviously, we won’t run this program for large N.
  The goal is simply to make sure that matrix blocks are initialized
  correctly on all processes.

<div class="ui tab segment" data-tab="outer_product">
  <div class="ui container segment raised">In this activity we implement the matrix multiplication algorithm.

  <p class="ui">
  Implement a program called <code>matmul</code> (<code>matmul.c</code>), which builds on your <code>matmul_init</code>
  program from the previous activity and implements the outer-product matrix multiplication algorithm.
</p>

<p class="ui">
The principle of the outer-product algorithm, as might be expected, is that a matrix multiplication
  can be performed as a sequence of outer-products. You may have covered this algorithm in a course,
  and it is of course well-document in various texts. You may expand below to get a brief description
  of the algorithm, which should be sufficient for you do do this step even if you've never seen
  the outer-product algorithm before.
</p>

    How does the outer-product algorithm work?
  </div>
  <div class=" content">
    <div class="ui container message ">

      <p class="ui">
        Consider the execution with p<sup>2</sup> processes, where each process is identified
        by 2-D coordinates between 0 and p-1.  For the duration of the algorithm,
        process p<sub>i,j</sub> holds a block of matrix A, a block of matrix B, and a block of
        matrix C, which it computes. The algorithm proceeds in p steps, and at each step each process
        updates its block of matrix C.
      </p>

      <p class="ui">
        Let us refer to the block of matrices A, B, and C held by process p<sub>i,j</sub> as
        A<sub>i,j</sub>, B<sub>i,j</sub>, and C<sub>i,j</sub>. The principle of the algorithm
        is simply stated as:
        <b>
          At step k, each process p<sub>i,j</sub> computes:
          C<sub>i,j</sub> += A<sub>i,k</sub> x B<sub>k,j</sub>.
        </b>
        You can easily verify that this makes sense, meaning that after p steps matrix C
        is equal to AxB.
      </p>

      <p class="ui">
        Because process p<sub>i,j</sub> only holds A<sub>i,j</sub> and B<sub>i,j</sub>, the above
        implies communication. More specifically, at step k:
      <div class="ui list bulleted">
        <div class="ui item"> Each process p<sub>i,k</sub> must broadcast A<sub>i,k</sub> to all processes p<sub>i,*</sub></div>
        <div class="ui item"> Each process p<sub>k,j</sub> must broadcast B<sub>k,j</sub> to all processes p<sub>*,j</sub></div>
      </div>
      </p>

      <p class="ui">
        As a result, at each iteration, each process is involved in 2 broadcasts (either as a sender or as a receiver).
        Blocks of A
        are broadcasted along rows of the process grid, and blocks of B are broadcasted along columns of the process grid. This is
        typically depicted in a figure as follows (recall that block indices are identical to the indices of the processes that hold them). This
        figure is for the second step k=1:
      </p>

      <p style="text-align:center;" class="ui">
        <img align="center" src="./outer_product.jpg" width="450" />
      </p>

      <p class="ui">
        Given the above, the high-level pseudo-code of the algorithm is straightforward:

      <div class="ui container raised segment">
        <pre>
        // For process p<sub>i,j</sub>
        for k = 0 to p-1
                participate in a broadcast in my process row for block A<sub>i,k</sub>
                  // (I am the source if k==j)
                participate in a broadcast in my process column for block B<sub>k,j</sub>
                  // (I am the source if k==i)
                C += A<sub>i,k</sub> * B<sub>k,j</sub>
        </pre>
      </div>
      </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>


<br />

<p class="ui">
  <b>Implementing "broadcasts": </b> The algorithm involves broadcasts in process rows and process columns. In MPI, a broadcast
  must involve all processes in a communicator. Thus, one option to implement the
  algorithm is to create 2p communicators, one for each process row and one for each
  process column. <code>MPI_Bcast</code> can then be used for these communicators. Communicators
  can be easily created using the <code>MPI_Comm_split</code> function (see the MPI documentation). The alternative
  is to rely on sequences of point-to-point communications, which isn't as pretty and likely not as efficient.
</p>

<p class="ui">
  <b>Result validation</b>: Recall that we compute a particular matrix product. To validate the result once the outer-product algorithm
  has finished, each process must compute the sum of all the elements in its block of C. These sums are then
  all added up together (using <code>MPI_Reduce</code> is the way to go), and the process of rank 0 prints out
  the sum. This process then computes the difference with the analytical formula:
  <i>N<sup>3</sup> (N - 1)<sup>2</sup> / 2</i>. This process should print out an error message if the
  two values don't match (beware of casts and round-off; you likely want to do everything in double precision
  and check that the absolute value of the difference of the two values is below some small epsilon, instead
  of testing for equality with the '==' operator).
  <i></i>
</p>

<p>For debugging purposes, remember that it's a good idea to insert calls to <code>MPI_Barrier</code>
  so that debugging output from the program can be structured step-by-step.

  <p class="ui">
    Congratulations for making it this far. You have learned to implement
    a moderately complex algorithm using 2-D data distribution and communication
    patterns that involve subset of the processes. This algorithm and its implementation
    are very typical of parallel numerical linear algebra implementations, and is
    among the simplest. Topic #4 contains a module in which we use your implementation
    as a starting point and explore performance issues, with the goal of reducing
    the performance penalty of communications.
