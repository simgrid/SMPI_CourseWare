  <h3 class="ui header">What have we learned?</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    Congratulations for making it this far. You have learned to implement
    a moderately complex algorithm using 2-D data distribution and communication
    patterns that involve subset of the processes. This algorithm and its implementation
    are very typical of parallel numerical linear algebra implementations, and is
    among the simplest. Topic #4 contains a module in which we use your implementation
    as a starting point and explore performance issues, with the goal of reducing
    the performance penalty of communications.

  <h3 class="ui header">What was difficult?</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    In a README file write a brief "essay" explaining what you found
    surprising/challenging, and what solutions you used to solve
    your difficulties. Are you happy with your implementations? Do you
    see room for improvement?
