<h3 class="ui header">Overview</h3>

  <p class="ui">This topic focuses on implementation of "rigid" parallel program, i.e.,
     programs in which the data distribution scheme and the communication patterns
     are regular and static. The learning objectives are similar to those in Topic #1,
     but on steroids. The focus is mostly on correctness and a little bit
     on performance.
