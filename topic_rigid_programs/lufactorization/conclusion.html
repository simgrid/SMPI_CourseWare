  <h3 class="ui header">What have we learned?</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    Congratulations for making it this far. You have learned to implement
    a moderately complex algorithm using a 1-D data distribution . This algorithm and its implementation
    are very typical of parallel numerical linear algebra implementations, but it overly simplistic. In fact,
    many optimization techniques are known to make the parallelization more efficient, in particular to
    hide the communication latencies. Hiding these latencies is the theme of Topic #4.

  <h3 class="ui header">What was difficult?</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    In a README file write a brief "essay" explaining what you found
    surprising/challenging, and what solutions you used to solve
    your difficulties. Are you happy with your implementations? Do you
    see room for improvement?
