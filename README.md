# SMPI_CourseWare

Set of hands-on pedagogic activities centered on teaching
high performance computing and distributed memory computing
_in simulation_, using Simulated MPI (SMPI) provided as part of the
[SimGrid project](http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/)).

This repository (master branch) contains the source (i.e., jekyll configuration files and mardown files) as well as a script to generate the Web content (gh-pages branch).

The Web content can be seen 
[on this github.io page](https://simgrid.github.io/SMPI_CourseWare/).

The Jekyll theme is based on 
[Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)
