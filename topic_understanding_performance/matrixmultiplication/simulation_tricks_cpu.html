  Experiments with large matrices are necessary to study scalability, but unfortunately these experiments are cpu-intensive,
  whether on a real platform or in simulation. One advantage of simulation is that one can play tricks to reduce cpu expenses, essentially
  by not performing actual computation.
  This is something researchers often do in simulation and in this module you're doing it too.
</p>

<p class="ui">
  When SMPI encounters a basic block of computation in your program, it executes the block
  and times it to  generate the correct delay in simulation. If this
  code takes 1 hour to run on your machine, then the simulation will then take at least 1
  hour. If you are simulating 100 processes each computing for 1
  hour, then the simulation will take 100 hours! This is because SMPI runs on a single core, running
  MPI processes in round-robin fashion. This sounds bad, but SMPI provides several ways
  to mitigate this problem.  For instance, one can tell the simulator:
  "Execute/time the code only the first time you encounter it".  A more radical
  option is to  tell the simulator: "When you encounter this basic
  block, don't run it at all. Instead, I am telling you how many flops it involves
  and simply compute the delay by dividing this number of flops by the compute speed."
  In both cases, <b>the code no longer computes correct results</b>. But the idea is that for
  deterministic basic blocks, such as the computational part of matrix multiplication, the general performance behavior is preserved,
  and a simple re-calibration will lead to sufficiently accurate simulation results (this has been shown in SMPI research papers and
  by other researchers before SMPI even existed).

In this step we use the second option above, i.e., avoiding computation altogether. Consider the sample
  basic block below:
</p>

<div class="ui container segment raised">
{% highlight C %}
for (i=0; i < N; i++) {
  sum = sum * 3.0 * x * y;
}
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

This loop performs <i>O(N)</i> floating point operations, and in your SMPI code you can replace it by:

<div class="ui container segment raised">
  {% highlight C %}
  double flops = (double)N * (double)FLOP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR ;
  SMPI_SAMPLE_FLOPS(flops) {
    // for (i=0; i < N; i++) {
    //   sum = sum * 3.0 * x * y;
  }
  {% endhighlight %}
</div>
(note that the original code is simply commented-out without the <code>SMPI_SAMPLE_FLOPS</code> macro / basic block, which is
likely a good idea instead of simply deleting it. The <code>FLOP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR</code> constant
is the constant factor hidden in the <i>O(N)</i> asymptotic complexity. In step #3 we use calibration to determine
an appropriate value. 

<p class="ui">
Modify your program to do the above, for the basic block that multiplies matrix blocks. At this point,
since your code doesn't compute anything useful, you can also comment out the part of the code that
initializes the matrices and checks the validity of the results (in fact you really want to comment out the latter
to avoid "invalid results" messages). For now use an arbitrary value for <code>FLOP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR</code> so
that you can compile and debug your program, and pay no attention to the simulated performance.
