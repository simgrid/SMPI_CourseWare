  <h3 class="ui header">Overview</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    <b>Objective: </b> To analyze (mostly experimentally) the performance and
    scalability of an implementation
       of the outer-product algorithm for multiplying matrices.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ui header">Prerequisite </h3>

  <p class="ui">
<b>    This module uses the program developed in the Matrix Multiplication module in Topic #3. You must
    have completed that module to do this one. </b>

  <h3 class="ui header">Simulation Calibration</h3>

  <p class="ui">

  To make the simulation results consistent regardless of your computer we first calibrate the simulation.
  More specifically, we simulate a parallel platform in which each processor computes at a rate of 200Gflops.  Since
  SMPI measures compute times on your own machine, we need to tell SMPI how fast your machine is, which is
  SMPI is done by passing a particular floating point value to
  <code>smpirun</code> using the <code>--cfg=smpi/host-speed:VALUE</code> command-line option.

  </p>

  <p class="ui">
    A python script called <a
    href="./calibrate_flops.py"><code>calibrate_flops.py</code></a> is
    provided, which you should run once on your idle computer (or on your Docker container). This script
    performs a binary search to find the necessary calibration factor,
    which is printed to the screen and should be passed to the
    <code>--cfg=smpi/host-speed</code> command-line option.  Of course,
    if you change computer, you'll have to re-run the script to find a new
    calibration factor.

    <li class="item"><b>Activity #1:</b> Observe the impact of network performance on application performance.</li>
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #2:</b> Quantify algorithm scalability.</li>
    <!--<li class="item"><b>Activity #3:</b> Use asynchronous communication to improve performance.</li>-->
