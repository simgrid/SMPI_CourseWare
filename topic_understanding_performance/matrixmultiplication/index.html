  <h3 class="ui header">Overview</h3>

  <p class="ui">
    <b>Objective: </b> To analyze (mostly experimentally) the performance and
    scalability of an implementation
       of the outer-product algorithm for multiplying matrices.
  </p>

</div>



<div class="ui container raised segment fluid">

  <h3 class="ui header">Prerequisite </h3>

  <h3 class="ui header">Simulation Calibration</h3>

  <p class="ui">

  To make the simulation results consistent regardless of your computer we first calibrate the simulation.
  More specifically, we simulate a parallel platform in which each processor computes at a rate of 200Gflops.  Since
  SMPI measures compute times on your own machine, we need to tell SMPI how fast your machine is, which is
  SMPI is done by passing a particular floating point value to
  <code>smpirun</code> using the <code>--cfg=smpi/host-speed:VALUE</code> command-line option.

  </p>

  <p class="ui">
    A python script called <a href="./calibrate_flops.py"><code>calibrate_flops.py</code></a> is
    provided, which you should run once on your idle computer (or on your Docker container). This script
    performs a binary search to find the necessary calibration factor,
    which is printed to the screen and should be passed to the
    <code>--cfg=smpi/host-speed</code> command-line option.  Of course,
    if you change computer, you'll have to re-run the script to find a new
    calibration factor.

  </p>


</div>



<div class="ui container segment raised fluid">
  <h3 class="ui header">Roadmap</h3>
  <p class="ui">This module consists of <b>2 activities, each described in its own tab above, which should be done in

  </p>
  <ul class="ui list">
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #1:</b> Observe the impact of network performance on application performance.</li>
    <li class="item"><b>Activity #2:</b> Quantify algorithm scalability.</li>
    <!--<li class="item"><b>Activity #3:</b> Use asynchronous communication to improve performance.</li>-->
  </ul>
</div>


<div class="ui container segment raised fluid">
  <h3 class="ui header">What to turn in</h3>
  <p class="ui">You should turn in a single archive (or a github repo) with:
  <div class="ui bulleted list">
    <div class="item">All source code</div>
    <div class="item">XML platform files and hostfiles (see details in the activities)</div>
    <div class="item">A Makefile that compiles all executables (and has a 'clean' target!)</div>
  </div>
  </p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="ui tab segment " data-tab="network_speed">
  <div class="ui container segment raised">In this activity we measure and understand the impact of network communication
  on application performance. This activity consists of the two steps below.
</div>

<div class="ui top attached tabular menu">
  <a class="item active" data-tab="network_impact">Step #1: Impact of the network</a>

  <p class="ui">
  In this step we run experiments on a simulated 1600-host cluster with the
  <a href="./cluster_1600.xml"><code>cluster_1600.xml</code></a> platform file and  accompanying
  <a href="./hostfile_1600.txt"><code>hostfile_1600.txt</code></a> hostfile.
</p>

<p class="ui">
  First, augment your <code>matmul</code> program so that it prints out the wallclock time to perform the
  matrix multiplication, in seconds (Using <code>MPI_Wtime</code> is a good idea).
  </p>

<p class="ui">
  Run your program for N = 1600 on the above platform using p = 1, 4, 16, 64, 100, and 400 processes. For each
  number of processes, record the simulated wallclock time, averaged over 5 trials.
  </p>

<p class="ui">
  Now, modify the platform file to set the network latency to 0 and the bandwidth to a very large value,
  so as to simulate an ideal platform in which the network is close to infinitely fast. Re-run the experiments above.
  </p>

<p class="ui">
Plot speed-up curves (speedup vs. number of processors) for the two series of experiments above.
What parallel efficiency can you achieve with p = 400 processes on the ideal vs. the non-ideal platform?
  What do you conclude about the application’s prospects for this matrix size on a real machine?
</p>

<p class="ui">
  <i>Note:</i>
The simulations takes time and memory. You can decrease the scale as needed in case you can't run it on your machine.
  Just for reference, these simulations run well under 10 minutes minutes on the author's laptop.
</p>


</div>


<div class="ui bottom attached tab segment " data-tab="communication_share">

  <p class="ui">
Instrument your code so that at the end of execution, in addition to wallclock time,
  it also reports the time spent in communication (which you measure via additional calls
  to <code>MPI_Wtime</code>). Using p=16 processes, run experiments with the original (i.e., with
  the original network) platform file for N = 8X for X ∈ {100,110,120,...,400}, with 5 trials per experiment.
  This runs in about 10 minutes on the author's laptop.
  </p>

<p class="ui">
On the same plot show the computation time and the communication time vs. the matrix size.
  What do the trends look like? Do they make sense w.r.t. to some asymptotic models of
  computation and communication volumes?
  Is this good news or bad news for multiplying large matrices on our platform?
</p>

</div>


</div>

<div class="ui tab segment " data-tab="scalability">
  <div class="ui container segment raised">In this activity we experiment with large matrices, to see if performance
  can scale reasonably well with large numbers of processors. In steps #1 and #2 below we play "simulation tricks" to avoid
  running too memory-intensive / cpu-intensive simulations. In step #3 we re-calibrate the simulation, and
  in step #4 we re-run experiments to quantify application scalability.
</div>

<div class="ui top attached tabular menu">

</div>


<div class="ui bottom attached tab segment active" data-tab="simulation_tricks_cpu">

  <p class="ui">
  Experiments with large matrices are necessary to study scalability, but unfortunately these experiments are cpu-intensive,
  whether on a real platform or in simulation. One advantage of simulation is that one can play tricks to reduce cpu expenses, essentially
  by not performing actual computation.
  This is something researchers often do in simulation and in this module you're doing it too.
</p>

<p class="ui">
  When SMPI encounters a basic block of computation in your program, it executes the block
  and times it to  generate the correct delay in simulation. If this
  code takes 1 hour to run on your machine, then the simulation will then take at least 1
  hour. If you are simulating 100 processes each computing for 1
  hour, then the simulation will take 100 hours! This is because SMPI runs on a single core, running
  MPI processes in round-robin fashion. This sounds bad, but SMPI provides several ways
  to mitigate this problem.  For instance, one can tell the simulator:
  "Execute/time the code only the first time you encounter it".  A more radical
  option is to  tell the simulator: "When you encounter this basic
  block, don't run it at all. Instead, I am telling you how many flops it involves
  and simply compute the delay by dividing this number of flops by the compute speed."
  In both cases, <b>the code no longer computes correct results</b>. But the idea is that for
  deterministic basic blocks, such as the computational part of matrix multiplication, the general performance behavior is preserved,
  and a simple re-calibration will lead to sufficiently accurate simulation results (this has been shown in SMPI research papers and
  by other researchers before SMPI even existed).
</p>

<p class="ui">
In this step we use the second option above, i.e., avoiding computation altogether. Consider the sample
  basic block below:
</p>

<div class="ui container segment raised">

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">N</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">sum</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sum</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="mi">0</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

</div>

This loop performs <i>O(N)</i> floating point operations, and in your SMPI code you can replace it by:

<div class="ui container segment raised">
  
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">  <span class="kt">double</span> <span class="n">flops</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">double</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="n">N</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">double</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="n">FLOP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR</span> <span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="n">SMPI_SAMPLE_FLOPS</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">flops</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="c1">// for (i=0; i &lt; N; i++) {</span>
    <span class="c1">//   sum = sum * 3.0 * x * y;</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
  </code></pre></figure>

</div>
(note that the original code is simply commented-out without the <code>SMPI_SAMPLE_FLOPS</code> macro / basic block, which is
likely a good idea instead of simply deleting it. The <code>FLOP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR</code> constant
is the constant factor hidden in the <i>O(N)</i> asymptotic complexity. In step #3 we use calibration to determine
an appropriate value. 

<p class="ui">
Modify your program to do the above, for the basic block that multiplies matrix blocks. At this point,
since your code doesn't compute anything useful, you can also comment out the part of the code that
initializes the matrices and checks the validity of the results (in fact you really want to comment out the latter
to avoid "invalid results" messages). For now use an arbitrary value for <code>FLOP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR</code> so
that you can compile and debug your program, and pay no attention to the simulated performance.
</p>


</div>


<div class="ui bottom attached tab segment " data-tab="simulation_tricks_mem">

  <p class="ui">
  Besides cpu time, another limiting factor for scalable simulation is memory space. If
  I want to use SMPI to simulate 100 processes that each uses 1GiB of heap space,
  then I need a single machine with 100GiB of RAM! Again, this sounds bad, which is why
  SMPI allows simulated processes to use the same heap allocations!! This leads to
  nonsensical computation since processes overwrite each other's updates in the same
  allocated memory zones. But, for deterministic application such as matrix multiply,
  overall performance behavior is sufficiently preserved to lead to sufficiently accurate
  simulation results (again, see SMPI research papers and those referenced therein).
</p>

<p class="ui">
  The above is straightforward with SMPI:
  <div class="ui bulleted list">
    <div class="ui item">Replace <code>malloc</code> by <code>SMPI_SHARED_MALLOC</code>;</div>
    <div class="ui item">Replace <code>free</code> by <code>SMPI_SHARED_FREE</code>.</div>
  </div>
</p>

<p class="ui">
  Do the above in your program. You now have a program that computes
  nothing useful at all, but still outputs a simulated wallclock time that research shows
  is sufficiently accurate to draw meaningful conclusions for our purpose!
  The point is that this program can be executed faster and for larger matrices.
  We now have an interesting simulation performance trade-off. With a lot of processes, we can scale the memory up.
  For instance, say the memory space needed for the (sequential) matrix multiplication is 100GiB.
  You can't run the simulation of this computation on your laptop. However, if you simulate a parallel
  execution with 100 processes, the above memory trick makes it so that you only need 1GiB of RAM to run the simulation.
  However, with a lot of processes, the time to simulate the broadcasts with large data sizes is large
  (due to the sheer number of individual point-to-point messages).
  So, some simulations will take too much space, and some simulations will take too much time.
  Nevertheless, our CPU and memory simulation "tricks" significantly widens the range of simulation experiments
  that can be done in practice.
  </p>


</div>


<div class="ui bottom attached tab segment " data-tab="recalibration">

  <p class="ui">
  One problem with our CPU trick is that the simulated wall-clock time will no longer be coherent with our simulation platform, i.e., it
  no longer match with our <code>--cfg=smpi/host-speed</code> command-line option since we use the
  <code>SMPI_SAMPLE_FLOPS</code> macro. Instead, we need
  to determine a reasonable value for <code>FLOP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR</code>.
  </p>

<p class="ui">
  Run your original (i.e., without the "simulation tricks") program from the matrix multiplication module in Topic #3,
 using
  <a href="./cluster_1600.xml"><code>cluster_1600.xml</code></a> and
  <a href="./hostfile_1600.txt"><code>hostfile_1600.txt</code></a>, for a matrix of size 2000x2000, with <b>p=4 process</b>.
  Then empirically determine a value of <code>FLOP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR</code>
  that leads to the same (or close) simulated elapsed time for your program with the "simulation tricks".
  Doing a binary search on <code>FLOP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR</code>, via a script, is great of course, but you
  can probably just do a quick trial-and-error manual search. Once you've found this value, hard-code it into your
  program, and voila.
</p>


</div>


<div class="ui bottom attached tab segment " data-tab="scalability_runs">

  <p class="ui">
  Now that your simulation is fully calibrated,
  run simulations, using
  <a href="./cluster_1600.xml"><code>cluster_1600.xml</code></a>  and
  <a href="./hostfile_1600.txt"><code>hostfile_1600.txt</code></a>, <b>with p=100 processors</b>,
  using matrices of increasing sizes up to as large as you can run them on your machine (in terms of memory and time), with 5 trials
  per matrix size.
  It may be a good idea to do a quick back-of-the-envelope memory footprint calculation to make sure you don’t exceed your RAM.

  </p>

<p class="ui">
  Plot an average efficiency vs. matrix size curve. 
  What do you conclude in terms of the scalability of the application? Are we in good shape if matrices are large?
