  In this step we run experiments on a simulated 1600-host cluster with the
  <a href="./cluster_1600.xml"><code>cluster_1600.xml</code></a> platform file and  accompanying
  <a href="./hostfile_1600.txt"><code>hostfile_1600.txt</code></a> hostfile.

<p class="ui">
  First, augment your <code>matmul</code> program so that it prints out the wallclock time to perform the
  matrix multiplication, in seconds (Using <code>MPI_Wtime</code> is a good idea).
  </p>

<p class="ui">
  Run your program for N = 1600 on the above platform using p = 1, 4, 16, 64, 100, and 400 processes. For each
  number of processes, record the simulated wallclock time, averaged over 5 trials.

<p class="ui">
  Now, modify the platform file to set the network latency to 0 and the bandwidth to a very large value,
  so as to simulate an ideal platform in which the network is close to infinitely fast. Re-run the experiments above.
  </p>

<p class="ui">
Plot speed-up curves (speedup vs. number of processors) for the two series of experiments above.
What parallel efficiency can you achieve with p = 400 processes on the ideal vs. the non-ideal platform?
  What do you conclude about the application’s prospects for this matrix size on a real machine?

  <i>Note:</i>
The simulations takes time and memory. You can decrease the scale as needed in case you can't run it on your machine.
  Just for reference, these simulations run well under 10 minutes minutes on the author's laptop.
