  Now that your simulation is fully calibrated,
  run simulations, using
  <a href="./cluster_1600.xml"><code>cluster_1600.xml</code></a>  and
  <a href="./hostfile_1600.txt"><code>hostfile_1600.txt</code></a>, <b>with p=100 processors</b>,
  using matrices of increasing sizes up to as large as you can run them on your machine (in terms of memory and time), with 5 trials
  per matrix size.
  It may be a good idea to do a quick back-of-the-envelope memory footprint calculation to make sure you don’t exceed your RAM.

  Plot an average efficiency vs. matrix size curve. 
  What do you conclude in terms of the scalability of the application? Are we in good shape if matrices are large?
