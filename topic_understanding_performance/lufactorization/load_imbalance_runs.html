  Now that your simulation is fully calibrated, augment your implementation (in <code>lu.c</code>) so that at the
  end of the execution the program prints out <i>the elapsed time</i> as well as the <i>percentage idle time</i>.
   The idle time corresponds to the column updates phase
  (i.e., at a given iteration some processors will have fewer columns to update than others, and will thus remain idle
  until all processors are ready to move on). As usual, it's a good idea to use <code>MPI_Wtime</code> to measure
  time, and it's ok to add calls to <code>MPI_Barrier</code> to make it easier to measure idle time at
  each process.  The percentage idle time is computed as the sum of all the individual idle times (which you can
  obtain using <code>MPI_Reduce</code>), divided by the product of the number of processes and the elapsed time.

  Run your code using
  <a href="./cluster_1600.xml"><code>cluster_1600.xml</code></a>  and
  <a href="./hostfile_1600.txt"><code>hostfile_1600.txt</code></a>, <b>but</b>
  edit <code>cluster_1600.xml</code> to make the network very fast (zero latency, huge bandwidth). This
  will allow us to take the network out of the equation for now.  Run your code for a
  32000x32000 matrix with p = 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 processes. On the same graph plot
  the elapsed time and the percentage idle time (using two different left and right vertical axes).

<p class="ui">
   In your <code>README</code> file describe what you observe. Is the idle time significant? Does the
   performance scale well as the number of processors increase? Can you explain why that is given
   what the implementation is doing?
