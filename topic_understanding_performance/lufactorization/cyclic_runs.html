 With the "simulation tricks" from Activity #1 enabled, we can now re-run the same experiments as that
 in Step #4 of Activity #1. That is,
 run your code using
 <a href="./cluster_1600.xml"><code>cluster_1600.xml</code></a>  and
 <a href="./hostfile_1600.txt"><code>hostfile_1600.txt</code></a>, <b>but</b>
 edit <code>cluster_1600.xml</code> to make the network very fast (zero latency, huge bandwidth).
 Run your code for a
 32000x32000 matrix with p = 1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 processes. On the same graph plot
 the elapsed time and the percentage idle time (using two different left and right vertical axes). It would
 be likely useful to plot the results from Activity #1, Step #4 on this same graph as well for easy comparison.

<p class="ui">
 In your <code>README</code> file describe what you observe. Does the cyclic distribution reduce
 idle time significantly?
