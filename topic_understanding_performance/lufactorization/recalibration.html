  One problem with our CPU trick is that the simulated wall-clock time will no longer be coherent with our simulation platform, i.e., it
  no longer has anything to do with our --cfg=smpi/running power command-line option since we use the
  <code>SMPI_SAMPLE_FLOPS</code> macro. Instead, we need
  to determine a reasonable value for <code>FLOP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR</code>.

  Run your original (i.e., without the "simulation tricks") program from the Matrix Multiplication module in Topic #3,
 using
  <a href=""><code>cluster_1600.xml</code></a> and
  <a href=""><code>hostfile_1600.txt</code></a>, for a matrix of size 2000x2000, with <b>p=4 process</b>.
  Then empirically determine a value of <code>FLOP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR</code>
  that leads to the same (or close) simulated elapsed time for your program with the "simulation tricks".
  Doing a binary search on <code>FLOP_CALIBRATION_FACTOR</code>, via a script, is great of course, but you
  can probably just do a quick trial-and-error manual search. Once you've find this value, hard-code it into your
  program, and voila.
