  Augment your program that that the Julia set is saved to a bmp file.
  The difference with Activity #2 is that now each process holds a tile, and
  yet the file must contains the pixels in row major order. So each process
  will have to append many times to the file, writing one piece of a row at a time.
  As a result, more complex coordination is required compared to
  Activity #2.

      The figure above show an example with 9 processes (2-D rank coordinates are shown
      in red), where each process holds a 4x8 tile (4 row segments).  The numbers on
      each segment indicate the sequence in which the pixels must be written to the
      file. In this example, there are 36 row segments. First process (0,0)
      writes its first segment, then process (0,1) writes its first segment, etc.  
      For instance, at step 20, process (1,1) writes its third segment. You must implement
          the "go ahead!" messaging scheme so that the processes write to the file in
          the correct order.

Using a tint of <code>1.0</code> at each process, this program should produce the
same images as that in Activity #2 (which can be useful for debugging). When using
<code>rank<sup>2</sup></code>, one sees a checkered pattern. Here is a sample
image generated
with 9 processors for n=300:
