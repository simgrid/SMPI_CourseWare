  We now implement our parallel Julia set application using a <i>2-D data distribution</i>. This means
  that each process now is in charge of a <b>tile</b> of the image in a logical checkerboard pattern. To
  make things simple we assume two things:

<div class="ui list bulleted">
  <div class="ui item"><b>the total number of processes used is always a perfect square, p<sup>2</sup></b></div>
  <div class="ui item"><b>n, the image height, is perfectly divisible by p</b></div>
</div>

</p>

<p class="ui">
  These assumptions will not change the spirit of the program, but simplify its implementation
  significantly. This is because each process is responsible for a tile of the image
  with height n/p and width 2n/p. This is the amount of memory each process should allocate.
</p>

<p class="ui">
  This 2-D data distribution complicates the global vs. local indexing issue that was
  discussed in Activity #2. The first thing to do is to figure out which process is responsible
  for which tile. A common approach is to use a row-major view of the processes. In other words,
  we think of a logical topology in which the processes are organized in a square grid (because
  our number of processes is a perfect square).  By default, MPI gives us only a linear (i.e., 1-D) rank.
  We "transform" this rank into a 2-D rank where each process has a "row" and a "column", using a row-major
  scheme. This can be done with a little bit of discrete math (alternately, MPI provides
  a <code>MPI_Cart_coords</code> function that does this for you).  Based on its 2-D coordinates, a process
  now knows which tile is is responsible for.

        Let's say our image has height 300 and width 600, and that we are using 9 processes. Each process
        then is responsible for a 100x200 tile. Let's see this on a "picture":

        Every white cell above represents a tile. The (global) row
        and column index ranges for the pixels in the tile are shown
        in the first row/column. In each tile is shown the rank of the process
        that owns it, and the 2-D rank of this process (computed based
        in the process rank and  p). For instance, process of rank 5
        has 2-D rank (1,2), meaning that it is in the 2nd row and the 3rd
        column of the logical 3x3 process grid. As such, it is responsible
        for image pixels between rows 100 and 199 and between columns 400 and 599. In
        "array slice notation, this would be [100:199, 400:599].
