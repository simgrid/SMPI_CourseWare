  Augment your program so that each process allocates space to store the pixels it needs to compute, and
  then computes them. <b>A process must only allocate space for the pixels it needs to compute</b>.  In practice,
  each process runs on a different hosts, and one wishes to compute a large image that does not fit in the
  memory of a single host (which is one of the main motivations for going the "distributed-memory computing" route).
</p>

<p class="ui">
<b> Have each process print its rank and time (using <tt>MPI_Wtime()</tt>, which returns a double) right before
    performing the computation and right after performing the computation!</b>. Our cluster is not completely
homogeneous, and these (simulated) times will show it. 
</p>

<p class="ui">
  The main difficulty here is keeping local vs. global indexing straight. That is, although as programmers
  we think of the image as an array of, say, N pixels, no N-pixel array is ever allocated in the program (only
  smaller arrays allocated by each process).

<p class="ui">One of the difficulties of distributed-memory computing is just that... well... memory is distributed.
      Say my sequential non-distributed-memory program processes 2000 items. I can simply store them
      in a 2000-item array.  Say now that I need to use distributed-memory computing (perhaps 2000 items don't
      fit in the memory of a single host, perhaps I just want to compute faster). I now use 20 hosts instead
      of 1, and on each host one process runs and allocates memory for 100 items.  So, at each process I allocate
      a 100-item array. So far, so good.</p>

      <p class="ui"> The problem is that when my sequential program says "process item #i", for some i between 0
        and 1999, I need to figure out two things:
      </p>

      <div class="ui list bulleted">
      <div class="ui item">Which process holds item #i?</div>
      <div class="ui item">In that process' item array, at which index is item #i stored?</div>
      </div>

      <p class="ui">
      The answer to the above depends on the data distribution!  Say that process 0 (i.e., process with
        rank 0) holds items 0 to 99 (global indices), process 1 holds items 100 to 199 (global indices), etc.
        So, for a given i between 0 and 1999, with this data distribution, I have:
      </p>
      <div class="ui list bulleted">
        <div class="ui item">Item #i is held by process with rank i/100</div>
        <div class="ui item">At that process, item #i is store at index i%100 of the item array</div>
      </div>

      <p class="ui">i%100 ("i modulo 100") above is called the <i>local index</i> (i.e., where the element is stored
      in the array declared locally in the process), as opposed to i which is the <i>global index</i>.</p>

      <p>The more complicated the distribution, the more intricate the global-to-local or local-to-global
      conversion. 1-D data distributions, like the one above, are the simplest. In the next activity we'll deal with a 2-D
      data distribution.</p>
