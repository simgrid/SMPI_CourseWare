<p class="ui">
Augment your program so that it saves the image to a file called <code>julia.bmp</code>, which stores
the image in the bmp format.  A bmp file consists of two parts:
  <div class="ui list bulleted">
  <div class="ui item"> A header </div>
  <div class="ui item"> The 3-byte pixels of the image, in a row-major fashion</div>
</div>

  </p>

<p class="ui">
  To make the above easier you are first provided with a helper C function, <code>write_bmp_header()</code>, which
  writes to a file the 40-byte header required for a bmp file.

<div class="ui accordion fluid">
  <div class=" title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
    See the source of write_bmp_header()...
  </div>
  <div class=" content">
    <div class="ui raised container segment ">
{% highlight c %}
{% include_relative write_bmp_header.c %}
{% endhighlight %}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


<p class="ui">
  Second, here is a code fragment that shows how to write the pixels in a 1-D pixed array  to 
  a bpm file (opened as file <code>output_file</code>) after the header has been written:
</p>

{% highlight c %}
// Writing the pixels after the header
for (y=0; y < height; y++) {
  for (x=0; x < width; x++) {
    fwrite(&(pixels[y * 3 * width + x * 3]), sizeof(char), 3, output_file);
  }
  // padding in case of an even number of pixels per row
  unsigned char padding[3] = {0,0,0};
  fwrite(padding, sizeof(char), ((width * 3) % 4), output_file);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p class="ui">
  Given the above, it should be straightforward to augment your program so that it
  produces a bmp file of the Julia set.  Once this is done, you are ready
  to go on to Activity #2, in which we make the program parallel!
