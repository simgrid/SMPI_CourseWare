Implement a C (or C++) program called <code>sequential_julia</code> (source file  <code>sequential_julia.c</code>) that:

<div class="ui list bulleted">
  <div class="item">Takes a single command-line argument, n, an <code>integer</code> that's strictly positive.</div>
  <div class="item">Allocates an 1-D <code>unsigned char</code> n * (2 * n) *3 elements. This array is used to
    the pixels of an image with height (in pixels) of n width (in pixels) of 2n, where each pixel is encoded using 3 bytes (RGB
    values).
  </div>
  <div class="item">Fills this array with pixel values corresponding to the Julia set.</div>
</div>

<p class="ui">
  To make the above easier you are provided with one helper C function, <code>compute_julia_pixel()</code>, to which
  you pass the (x,y) coordinates of a pixed, the (width, height) dimensions of the image, a "tint" float (pass 1.0
  for now), and a pointer to 3 contiguous bytes (<code>unsigned char</code>). These bytes are set to appropriate
  RGB values (Red Green Blue) for displaying the Julia set.

    <div class="ui container raised segment">
      <h4 class="ui header">Storing 2-D data is a row-major 1-D array</h4>
      <p class="ui">
        You may find the use of a 1-D array to store the pixels surprising, since after all the image is 2-D. However, it is
        common to use 1-D arrays, especially when they are dynamically allocated. One option would be to allocate an array
        of pointers to
        1-D arrays, making it possible to access elements with the convenient syntax <code>Array[i][j]</code>.
        But this is typically a bad idea as it reduces locality (i.e., the efficient use of the cache), which in turns harms
        performance.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore, we instead store 2-D data into a 1-D array of contiguous elements. The "row-major" scheme consists in storing rows in sequence. In other
        terms, if the width of the image is <code>N</code>, then pixel (i,j) is stored as <code>Array[i * N + j]</code>. This is actually
        the scheme used by the C language to store 2-D arrays.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

Now that the program computes the Julia set pixels as a 1-D array of 3-byte elements, it would be nice to see them (if only to check
that they're set correctly). So move on to Step #2 (next tab)...
