  First you must pick on process to create the file and write the header to it
  (it is typical to pick process of rank 0).  Second, each process, after its done computing
  its pixels, waits for a "go ahead!" message from its predecessor, and then sends a "go ahead!"
  message to its successor.  The exceptions are process of rank 0, which does not need to wait for
  a message, and the last process, which does not need to send a message. It doesn't really matter
  what these messages contain (e.g., they can be a single byte, or even zero-byte messages), as the whole purpose is to

    What are logical topologies???
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p class="ui message">
      Although the above scheme is pretty simple, what we are really doing is creating a <i>logical topology</i>. That is,
      based on ranks, we impose structure on our set of processes. In this case, a "linear chain" in which process #i communicates
      with process #i+1. Probably the simplest structure. We will see examples of more complex logical topologies.
      Different applications lend themselves naturally to different logical topologies (rings, grids, trees, etc.).
      One interesting question, which is outside
      the score of this topic, is how well the logical topology matches the physical topology of the actual
      parallel platform in use (a good match typically boosts performance).  Ideally, one can define a logical topology
      that makes writing the application intuitive, and that is also well-matched to the physical platform.
