Learning Objectives
</h3>

<b>The broad learning objective of SMPI CourseWare is to learn how to write efficient message-passing
programs that run on distributed-memory architectures, using the MPI standard.</b>

Specific learning objectives include:
<div class="ui list bulleted">
<div class="ui item"> Understand general distributed-memory programming techniques and learn standard solutions to common problems</div>
<div class="ui item"> Learn how to implement distributed-memory programs, going from traditional "rigid" programs to more "dynamic" programs</div>
<div class="ui item"> Understand and experience performance trade-offs when implementing and executing distributed-memory programs on ranges of distributed-memory platforms</div>
</div>
</div>

Approach
</h3>

While many curricular materials have been developed homework assignments to be executed
on parallel platforms, SMPI CourseWare relies on <b>simulation</b>. This approach has the following advantages:


<div class="ui list bulleted">
<div class="ui item"> No need to have access to a distributed-memory platform, such as a cluster</div>
<div class="ui item"> Ability to run many experiments quickly and reproducibly on one's own computer</div>
<div class="ui item"> Ability to explore arbitrary "what if?" scenarios, in particular to experience performance trade-offs first-hand</div>
</div>

The above is accomplished using
<a href="http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/simgrid/latest/doc/group__SMPI__API.html">SMPI</a> (Simulated MPI),
which is provided as part of the <a href="http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr">SimGrid</a> project. SMPI simulates the execution of unmodified MPI applications.<br><br>
