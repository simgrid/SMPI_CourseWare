Augment your code in <code>bcast_solution.c</code> with an implementation called
  <b>asynchronous_pipelined_bintree_bcast</b> that
  implements the broadcast along a binary tree, splitting the message into chunks for
  <b>pipelining</b> and using <b>asynchronous communication</b>. The root of the broadcast,
  process of rank #0, is also the root of the binary tree. Note that the binary tree may
  not be complete if the number of processors is not of the form 2<sup>n</sup> âˆ’ 1.

<p class="ui">
  Use a <b>level order traversal numbering</b> of the nodes in your tree:
  rank 0 has rank 1 as its left child and rank 2 as its right child,
  rank 1 has rank 3 as its left child and rank 4 as its right child,
  etc. The reason why we impose this order is that this is also the order used to number
  processes in the platform description file used for experimental evaluations (see Step #2). The idea
  is that the logical binary tree of processes is identical to the physical binary tree of processors
  (process #i runs on processor #i).
