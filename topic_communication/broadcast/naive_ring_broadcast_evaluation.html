  Before you proceed with the evaluation of your two implementations, implement
  a third broadcast implementation, named <b>default_bcast</b>, that simply has all processes
  call <code>MPI_Bcast</code>. This is the MPI implementation of the broadcast collective communication,
  which in this module we implement "by hand" using point-to-point communications.
</p>

<p class="ui">
  We compare the performance of the three implementations on a <b>50-processor physical ring</b>. Although some
  supercomputers
  in the old days were designed with a ring network topology, this is no longer the case. The main drawback of a
  physical
  ring is that it has very large diameter (i.e., there can be ~n/2 hops between two processors in an n-processor ring).
  The main advantages
  is that the degree is low (2), which implies low cost, and that routing is straightforward. For now we assume a simple
  physical ring
  so as to better understand broadcast performance.

  It is pretty simple to generate a Simgrid platform file for a ring and the corresponding hostfile.
  You can download a Python script <a href="./generate_xml_ring_and_hostfile.py">(generate_xml_ring_and_hostfile.py)</a>
  that generates
  these two files given a number of processors passed as a command-line argument. Just in case,
  here are the files generated using this script for 50 processors: <a href="ring_50.xml">ring_50.xml</a> and
  <a href="hostfile_50.txt">hostfile_50.txt</a>.
</p>

<p class="ui">
  The way to invoke the program is as follows:
</p>

<div class="ui container raised segment">
  {% highlight text %}
  smpirun --cfg=smpi/bcast:mpich -np 50 
  -platform ring_50.xml -hostfile hostfile_50.txt
  ./bcast_skeleton <implementation name>
  {% endhighlight %}
</div>

<p class="ui">
  The <code>--cfg=smpi/bcase:mpich</code> flag above specifies that we simulate <code>MPI_Bcast</code> (for the
  default_bcast implementation) as implemented
  in MPICH. Other options are possible, but it's okay to stick with this implementation
</p>

<p class="ui">
  Answer the following questions:
<div class="ui list bulleted">
  <div class="ui item">What are the (simulated) wall-clock time of the three implementations on the 50-processor
    ring?
  </div>
  <div class="ui item">How far are your "by hand" implementations from the default
    broadcast?
  </div>
  <div class="ui item">You may observe that ring_bcast does not improve a lot over naive_bcast, which should
    be surprising to you. After all, naive_bcast sends long-haul messages while ring_bcast doesn't
    What do you think the reason
    is? To answer this question, you can instrument your code and run it on smaller rings to see when events happen and
    try to understand what's going on. Given that we're using simulation, you should take advantage of it and
    experiment with all kinds of platform configurations to gain understanding of the performance behavior. For
    instance,
    you can modify link latencies and bandwidths.
    The <code>MPI_Wtime</code> function is convenient to determine the current (simulated) date. This
    function returns the date as a double precision number (and is in fact already used in <code>bcast_skeleton.c</code>).

<p class="ui">
  <i>Warning:</i> SMPI implements sophisticated simulation models that capture many real-world effects (network
  protocol idiosyncrasies, MPI implementation idiosyncrasies).
  These effects will be seen in your experiments, just as they would on a real-world platform,
  and they tend to make performance behavior more difficult to understand. For instance, if you modify
  the buffer size, you will see non-linear effects on performance (e.g., broadcasting a buffer twice as large
  will not require exactly twice as much time, broadcasting a buffer 1 byte larger may increase broadcast time significantly).
