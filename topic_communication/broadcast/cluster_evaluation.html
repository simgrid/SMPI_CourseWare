  Report the (simulated) wall-clock time of
  default_bcast,
  asynchronous_pipelined_ring_bcast, and
  asynchronous_pipelined_bintree_bcast, on the following two
  platforms:

  <div class="ui list bulleted">

  <div class="ui item">A 64-processor cluster based on a single crossbar switch:
  <a href="./cluster_crossbar_64.xml">cluster_crossbar_64.xml</a>.

  <div class="ui item">A 64-processor cluster with a shared backbone:
    <a href="./cluster_backbone_64.xml">cluster_backbone_64.xml</a>.
  </div>
</div>

  You can use this hostfile: <a href="./hostfile_64.txt">hostfile_64.txt</a>.

  For asynchronous_pipelined_ring_bcast and
  asynchronous_pipelined_bintree_bcast use the "best chunksize" you determined
  in Activity #3 for the 50-processor ring platform.

  Answer the following question:
<div class="ui list bulleted">
  <div class="ui item">
    Overall, does it seem like it's a good idea to use the default MPI broadcast on these more standard platforms,
    or should one implement one's own?
    Note that the default broadcast has to pick a particular chunk size while we are "cheating" by picking
    an empirically good chunk size for our implementations!
