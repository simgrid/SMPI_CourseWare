  Run asynchronous_pipelined_ring_bcast using chunk sizes of 100,000 bytes,
  500,000 bytes,
  1,000,000 bytes,
  5,000,000 bytes,
  10,000,000 bytes,
  50,000,000 bytes, and
  100,000,000 (i.e., 1 chunk)
  on a 50-processor ring. Report the
  simulated execution times. Remember that the <a href="./generate_xml_ring_and_hostfile.py">generate_xml_ring_and_hostfile.py
  </a>Python script can be used to generate platform files and hostfiles.

  Answer the following questions:
<div class="ui list bulleted">
  <div class="ui item">
    Is the best chunk size the same as that for pipelined_ring_bcast?
    </div>
  <div class="ui item">
  When using the best chunk size for each of the two
    implementations (which may be the same if the answer to the previous question is "yes"),
    does the use of <code>MPI_Isend</code> help? By how much?</div>

  <div class="ui item">Is asynchronous_pipelined_ring_bcast faster than default_bcast or slower? By how much? </div>
  <div class="ui item">What do you conclude about the use of asynchronous communications for the purpose
        of a ring-based broadcast on a ring-shaped physical platform?</div>
