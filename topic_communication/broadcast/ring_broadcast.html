<p class="ui">
  Augment the <code>bcast_skeleton.c</code> program with a broadcast implementation named
  <b><code>ring_bcast</code></b> (first command-line argument). In this implementation,
  the process of rank 0 (the root of the broadcast) does a single <code>MPI_Send</code> of the
  whole buffer to the process of rank 1, the process of rank 1 then does a single <code>MPI_Send</code>
  to the process of rank 2, etc. In other words, the processes are logically organized as
  a <i>mono-directional ring</i>.  The last process should not send the buffer back to the root process (the root process
  does not call <code>MPI_Recv</code>).
  The second command-line argument (chunk size) is ignored.
