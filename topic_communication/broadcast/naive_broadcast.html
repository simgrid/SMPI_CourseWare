Look at the section of code in <code>bcast_skeleton.c</code> between the <code>TO IMPLEMENT: BEGIN</code>
and <code>TO IMPLEMENT: END</code> comments. The comments list the relevant variables that you will use 
in your code. You will note, in that section, that <code>bcast_skeleton.c</code> does an <code>#include bcast_solution.c</code>. So you should create a file <code>bcast_solution.c</code> in which you will write all the code for this assignment. This is more convenient that modifying the <code>bcast_skeleton.c</code> directly.

<p class="ui">
  In <code>bcast_solution.c</code>, implement a broadcast implementation named
  <b><code>naive_bcast</code></b> (first command-line argument). This implementation simply
  has the root of the broadcast (process with rank 0) perform a single
  point-to-point <code>MPI_Send</code> of the whole buffer to each other process (which performs an <code>MPI_Recv</code>).
  In other words, the processes are logically organized as
  a <i>mono-directional star</i> with process of rank 0 at the center.
  The second command-line argument (chunk size) is ignored.
