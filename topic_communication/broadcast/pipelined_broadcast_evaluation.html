  Run pipelined_ring_bcast using chunk sizes of
  100,000 bytes,
  500,000 bytes,
  1,000,000 bytes,
  5,000,000 bytes,
  10,000,000 bytes,
  50,000,000 bytes, and
  100,000,000 (i.e., 1 chunk),
  on a 20-processor ring, a 35-processor ring, and a 50-processor ring. Report the
  simulated execution times. Remember that the <a href="./generate_xml_ring_and_hostfile.py">generate_xml_ring_and_hostfile.py
  </a>Python script can be used to generate platform files and hostfiles.

  Answer the following questions:
<div class="ui list bulleted">
  <div class="ui item">
    What is the best chunk size for each of the three platforms?
  </div>
  <div class="ui item">Does this chunk size depend on the platform size?</div>
  <div class="ui item">You should observe that the wall-clock time is minimized for a chunk size that is neither the
    smallest nor the largest.
    Discuss why you think that is.
  </div>
  <div class="ui item">For a 50-processor ring, with the best chunk size determined above,
    by how much does pipelining help when compared to using a single chunk?
  </div>
  <div class="ui item"> How does the performance compare to that of the default MPI broadcast for that platform as seen in
    the previous question?
  </div>
  <div class="ui item">What do you conclude about the use of pipelined communications for the purpose
    of a ring-based broadcast on a ring-shaped physical platform?</div>
</div>

<p class="ui">
  <b>Warning: </b>  You will likely see some "odd" behavior. For instance, as the chunk size increases you may
  see the broadcast time decrease, increase, and then decrease again.  Or, if ou try very small chunk sizes,
  smaller than the ones above, you could see that for some particular chunk sizes the broadcast time is
  pretty low, if perhaps not the lowest across the board. These effects are because our simulated MPI captures
  many effects of network protocols and  MPI implementations. These effects take us away from simple analytical models of communication
  performance, in which there is no weirdness, but that simply don't match the reality of communication
  behavior in real-world parallel platforms. As a result, experimental results are often confusing and it is difficult
  to draw valid conclusions without looking at a lot of results.
