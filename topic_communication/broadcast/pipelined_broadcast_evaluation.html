  Run pipelined_ring_bcast using chunk sizes of 10,000 bytes, 20,000 bytes, 50,000 bytes,
  100,000 bytes, 200,000 bytes, 10,000,000 bytes (i.e., 1 chunk)
  on a 25-processor ring, a 50-processor ring, and a 100-processor ring. Report the
  simulated execution times. Remember that the <a href="./generate_xml_ring_and_hostfile.py">generate_xml_ring_and_hostfile.py
  </a>Python script can be used to generate platform files and hostfiles.

  Answer the following questions:
<div class="ui list bulleted">
  <div class="ui item">
    What is the best chunk size for each of the three platforms?
  </div>
  <div class="ui item">Does this chunk size depend on the platform size?</div>
  <div class="ui item">You should observe that the wall-clock time is minimized for a chunk size that is neither the
    smallest nor the largest.
    Discuss why you think that is.
  </div>
  <div class="ui item">For a 100-processor ring, with the best chunk size determined above,
    by how much does pipelining help when compared to using a single chunk?
  </div>
  <div class="ui item"> How does the performance compare to that of the default MPI broadcast for that platform as seen in
    the previous question?
  </div>
  <div class="ui item">What do you conclude about the use of pipelined communications for the purpose
    of a ring-based broadcast on a ring-shaped physical platform?</div>
