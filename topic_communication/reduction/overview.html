<p class="ui">A "reduce" operation is essentially the inverse of a broadcast plus some computation:
an associative/commutative operator is applied to data items located at each process,
and a final combined result is eventually available at a root process (e.g., process
of rank 0). </p>

<p class="ui">An interesting module would consist
in exploring efficient reduction algorithms, i.e., efficient orchestration of communications
(the time to apply the operator can be ignored for simplicity).

<p class="ui">Here is a possible setting:
<div class="ui list bulleted">
  <div class="ui item">Processors are interconnected via a crossbar switch</div>
  <div class="ui item">At a give time step a process (one per processor) can either send or receive, but not both</div>
  <div class="ui item">There are m data items at each process, and these can be split into chunks for pipelining
    <div class="ui list bulleted">
      <div class="ui item"> A seemingly simply, yet still interesting case, is to assume uniform chunks.
      </div>
      <div class="ui item"> Interesting effects may be achieved by allowing chunks of different sizes.
      </div>
    </div>

<p class="ui">
Here are three approaches that could be considered:
</p>

<p class="ui">
<b>Binomial tree without chunking:</b>
<div class="ui list bulleted">
      <div class="ui item">Step 0: Each odd numbered process sends to its left neighbor</div>
      <div class="ui item">Step 1: Each even-numbered process sends to its 2nd left neighbor</div>
      <div class="ui item">...</div>
</div>
</p>

<p class="ui">
<b>Pipeline tree:</b>
<div class="ui list bulleted">
      <div class="ui item">Chunk the data</div>
      <div class="ui item">Step 0: process n sends chunk 0 to process n − 1</div>
      <div class="ui item">Step 1: process n − 1 sends chunk 0 to process n − 2, and process n sends chunk 1 to process n − 1 </div>
      <div class="ui item">...</div>
</div>
</p>

<p class="ui">
<b>Binary reduction tree:</b>
<div class="ui list bulleted">
      <div class="ui item">Chunk the data</div>
      <div class="ui item">Step 0: processes n and n−1 send chunk 0 to process n−2 (two communications that happen in sequence), processes n−3 and n−4 send chunk 0 to process n−5, ...</div>
      <div class="ui item">Step 1: processes n and n−1 send chunk 1 to process n−2 (two communications that happen in sequence), processes n−3 and n-4 send chunk 0 to process n−5, ...  </div>
      <div class="ui item">...</div>
</div>
</p>

<div class="ui divider"></div>

<p class="ui">There are many other options to explore and compare.
The comparison could be both analytical (wall-clock time as of the number of processors, the number of messages, the chunk size,
the communication latency, and the communication bandwidth) and in simulation with an MPI implementation.</p>

<p class="ui">
In his research, Brad Lowery (see
<a href="http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/evelyne.blesle/pittsburgh/SLIDES/Brad_Lowery.pdf">these slides</a>),
proposes another strategy he calls a Greedy Tree, which is optimal for uniform segmentation (based on previous work).
A great activity option for this module would be to implement the Greedy Tree
and to reproduce Lowery's findings.</p>
