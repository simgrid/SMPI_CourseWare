SMPI simulates the execution of MPI applications by relying on the fast and accurate simulation
core provided by <a href="http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr">SimGrid</a>. The SMPI
  user (you!) must describe simulated platforms (i.e., sets of simulated hosts and network links, with
  some performance characteristics).  The SimGrid documentation provides ample information
  on platform descriptions, which are written in XML.  Below we simply show a series of examples,
  which should be sufficient for our purpose. Note that platform files are typically provided
  in each pedagogic module, but you may have to modify them.

<p class="ui">
  <b>A simple 3-host example:</b> At the most basic level, you can describe your simulated platform
  as a graph of hosts and network links. For instance:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;" class="ui">
  <img align="center" src="./3_hosts.jpg" width="240">
</p>


<div class="ui accordion">
  <div class=" title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
  See the XML platform description file...
  </div>
  <div class=" content">
    <div class="ui container segment">
    {% highlight XML %}
{% include_relative 3_hosts.xml %}
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="ui">
  In the above XML, note the way in which hosts, links, and routes are defined. Note that all hosts are defined
  with a <code>power</code> (i.e., compute speed in Gflops), and links with a <code>latency</code> (in us)
  and <code>bandwidth</code> (in Mbit/sec). Other units are possible and written as expected.
  By default, routes are symmetrical. See more information on the
  <a href="http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr">SimGrid Web site</a>.

<p class="ui">
  This XML file is intended for SimGrid v3.21 or earlier. To
  use it with more recent versions, you may have to convert it using the
  <code>simgrid_update_xml</code> program, as follows:

<div class="ui list">
  <div class="ui item"><code>simgrid_update_xml 3_hosts.xml</code></div>

  <b>A homogeneous cluster with a crossbar switch:</b> A very common parallel computing platform is a homogeneous
  cluster in which hosts are interconnected via a crossbar switch with as many ports as hosts, so that any disjoint
  pairs of hosts can communicate concurrently at full speed. For instance:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;" class="ui">
  <img align="center" src="./cluster_crossbar.jpg" width="470">
</p>


<div class="ui accordion">
  <div class=" title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
    See the XML platform description file...
  </div>
  <div class=" content">
    <div class="ui container segment">
    {% highlight XML %}
{% include_relative cluster_crossbar.xml %}
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="ui">
  In the above XML, note that one simply specifies a name prefix and suffix for each host, and then give an integer
  range (in the example the cluster contains 256 hosts). All hosts have the same power (1 Gflop/sec) and are connected to the switch via links with same latency (5 microseconds) and
  bandwidth (125 Mbit/sec). See more information on the
  <a href="http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr">SimGrid Web site</a>.

<p class="ui">
  <b>A homogeneous cluster with a shared backbone:</b> Another popular model for a parallel platform is that of a set of homogeneous
  hosts connected to a shared communication medium, a backbone, with some finite bandwidth capacity and on which communicating host pairs can
  experience contention. For instance:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;" class="ui">
  <img align="center" src="./cluster_backbone.jpg" width="470">
</p>


<div class="ui accordion">
  <div class=" title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
    See the XML platform description file...
  </div>
  <div class=" content">
    <div class="ui container segment">
    {% highlight XML %}
{% include_relative cluster_backbone.xml %}
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="ui">
  In the above XML, note that one specifies the latency and bandwidth of the link that connects a host to the backbone (in this
  example 50 microsec and 125 Mbit/sec), as well
  as the latency and bandwidth of the backbone itself (in this example
  500 microsec and 2.25 Gbit/sec). See more information on the
  <a href="http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr">SimGrid Web site</a>.

<p class="ui">
  <b>Two interconnected clusters:</b> One can connect clusters together and in fact build simulated platforms
  hierarchically in arbitrary fashions. For instance:
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;" class="ui">
  <img align="center" src="./2_clusters.jpg" width="470">
</p>


<div class="ui accordion">
  <div class=" title">
    <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
    See the XML platform description file...
  </div>
  <div class=" content">
    <div class="ui container segment">
    {% highlight XML %}
    {% include_relative 2_clusters.xml %}
    {% endhighlight %}
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="ui">
  The above XML is a bit more involved. See all details and documentation on the
