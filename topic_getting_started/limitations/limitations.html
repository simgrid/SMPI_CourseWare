  SMPI is robust, but it still has some limitations, as listed (and further explained) below:

        processes</h4>
    </div>
    <div class=" content">
      SMPI runs your MPI processes as threads within a single process. So when you declare a global variable in your
      program
      (which is rarely a good idea anyway), all the threads will share it, as threads do. That's likely not what you
      want
      in terms of your MPI processes. Use local variables instead.

        Do not use multithreading in your program
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div class=" content">
      Because SMPI already uses multithreading to simulate your MPI program's execution, if your MPI program uses
      threads
      as well, mayhem can occur. In practice, i.e., with real MPI, you typically want to use threads to exploit
      multi-core
      machines. In these pedagogic modules, simply pretend that each host is single-core and that you don't need to use
      threads.
      This has no impact on your learning MPI, and if/when you transition to real (as opposed to simulated) MPI
      executions, you
      can then simply multi-thread computational sections of your code.

      Yes, this is vague. <code>smpicc</code> compiles your code, and is fairly robust. But if you go crazy with
      tons of macros and C oddness, <code>smpicc</code> may get confused. It should happen only in rather extreme
      cases, but you are now warned.
